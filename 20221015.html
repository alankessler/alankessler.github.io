Yeah, I'm down here, and so I'm going to be taking a right on to 5th Avenue right now, and then making my loop on to Jefferson, but I don't know what kind of a prerequisite to take a right on 10th is not going to, but we're not going to be able to do that. Okay, how about Taylor? Can you come down 6th Avenue and take a left on Taylor and take that up? Yeah, I'm still just going to my regular layover at 5th in Jefferson, but I mean when we go back out to 10th Avenue, you know, we go up Jefferson and take a right on 10th Avenue. They have tape across, I couldn't even, I had to take a left at salmon, the next street was blocked. Yep, not a problem. Once you've annually over, take a right on 6th, left on Taylor, and take Taylor up to 10th. Perfect, thank you, I appreciate it. Thank you, YouTube, 1.32.</td></tr>

It's going to make me go left on Broadway. So they're blocked at tents in Jefferson. I couldn't get through. So I had to come when I was coming up tents. I mean, coming up 11. I had to make a left on the salmon and come down to get to 5th in Jefferson. Because they're blocked even further now from whatever I think are shooting that had happened earlier today.

My 2.91, am I taking a sister to the hotel like I normally do? 2.91. I have a good question. I'm guessing not. Do you have anything in your pouch? I didn't know the same thing when I started my day, but I'll look what I get there. And we've got time to figure it out still. Well, I just pulled out from north terminal at 1243. So we've got some time to figure it out. Okay, perfect. Yeah, I will let you know what I find out between now and then. I'm guessing not because I think they have the roads closed. But I'll let you know what we figure out. Thank you. No worries. This 2.91 always kind of gets lost in the shuffle. But I will get back to you. We're at the night at 0.20.</td></tr>

Yeah, you do a turnaround. It's supposed to be a six in Taylor, but in your case, I'm sorry. It's supposed to be a 50 Morrison, but in your case it's going to be on a 11th and Morrison. All right, so maybe go, go up 10, take a left on Taylor, or go up 11th, left on Taylor, left on 10, some Morrison. It's Taylor's after Morrison, right? Yeah, that's right. So yeah, just like that. All right, and what street do we turn right on off of six? Yeah, so I mean, once you go from 11th onto 10th, just go downtown until you get to Burnside and figure out how to figure out where to go. So let me go check the notes here. We'll give you a call back real quick for doing some research here. All right, copy that. I have to re-row in my messages, but it disappeared. So yeah, just whenever you know what street is turned right off of a fifth, just to give me a rang or shoot it on the mic at or something like that. Thank you. Thank you. I want to go.</td></tr>

And I'm pretty sure I probably go downtown and then turn around and come back out here to Sandy. If I'm wondering if I do like a turnaround thing or if I hang out at North Terminal, for what? Yeah, you do a turnaround. It's supposed to be a six in Taylor, but in your case, I'm sorry. It's supposed to be a 50 Morrison, but in your case it's going to be on a 11th and Morrison. All right, so maybe go, go up 10, take a left on Taylor, or go up 11th, left on Taylor, left on 10, some Morrison. It's Taylor's after Morrison, right? Yeah, that's right. So yeah, just like that. All right, and what street do we turn right on off of six? Yeah, so I mean, once you go from 11th onto 10th, just go downtown until you get to Burnside and figure out how to figure out where to go. So let me go check the notes here. We'll give you a call back real quick for doing some research here. All right, copy that. I have to re-row in my messages, but it disappeared. So yeah, just whenever you know what street is turned right off of a fifth, just to give me a rang or shoot it on the mic at or something like that. Thank you. Thank you. I want to go.</td></tr>

Yeah, you do a turnaround. It's supposed to be a six in Taylor, but in your case, I'm sorry. It's supposed to be a 50 Morrison, but in your case it's going to be on a 11th and Morrison. All right, so maybe go, go up 10, take a left on Taylor, or go up 11th, left on Taylor, left on 10, some Morrison. It's Taylor's after Morrison, right? Yeah, that's right. So yeah, just like that. All right, and what street do we turn right on off of six? Yeah, so I mean, once you go from 11th onto 10th, just go downtown until you get to Burnside and figure out how to figure out where to go. So let me go check the notes here. We'll give you a call back real quick for doing some research here. All right, copy that. I have to re-row in my messages, but it disappeared.

Yeah, I'm down here, and so I'm going to be taking a right on to 5th Avenue right now, and then making my loop on to Jefferson, but I don't know what kind of a prerequisite to take a right on 10th is not going to, but we're not going to be able to do that. Okay, how about Taylor? Can you come down 6th Avenue and take a left on Taylor and take that up? Yeah, I'm still just going to my regular layover at 5th in Jefferson, but I mean when we go back out to 10th Avenue, you know, we go up Jefferson and take a right on 10th Avenue. They have tape across, I couldn't even, I had to take a left at salmon, the next street was blocked. Yep, not a problem. Once you've annually over, take a right on 6th, left on Taylor, and take Taylor up to 10th. Perfect, thank you, I appreciate it. Thank you, YouTube, 1.32.</td></tr>
