Okay, turning off now, thank you. Not a problem. If you need to get in touch with this batch, make sure to use the fallback method, which is just, you know, your handset, like a two-way radio.

They do want you to try resetting the parking brake, because there's a couple of them that the brake will loose, and it kind of makes the drift...what did he say? It makes the lift drift out. So reset the parking brake, and then maintenance was also saying to make sure that the hand pump is closed tightly, and then try and pump it like you're folding it in, and then retry the lift. I did that while I was waiting for you, and I actually did get it to floor level manually, but I was going to go ahead and get this passenger off, because if we can't get the power back on, I can't move anywhere. Yeah, let's get this passenger off if you can, and then we'll continue to troubleshoot the lift to get you moving. All right, 10-4-0, RTT in just a couple of minutes. Yeah, give me an RTT.

Actually I was calling about 2252 cause I was there and I knocked twice, rang a bell, nobody ever came, I hung the door hanger, started walking back to the bus and then finally a guy came out after I'm already at like 8 minutes and he's like oh yeah, oh I didn't, sorry, didn't hear you. Then I had to wait like almost another 5 minutes so I'm like way behind. Copy that. Is he on board now? He is.

How's it going to help? I just want to let you guys know I didn't witness it, but it is still a pretty fresh wreck in the intersection at Stark and 187th. There is a car that is facing northbound, but it is currently blocking the right westbound lane, so it'll be basically the northmost lane, but it is eastbound. It's solving traffic. Police have not arrived from the scene yet, but the car is kind of parked there. Currently, traffic is getting around it. It's really backed up, but it is getting around it. You might want to set a supervisor in case he just had to block the intersection. Okay, and that was Stark and 187th westbound. It's just blocking the right lane at this point, correct? Affirmative. That's all correct. All right. We'll get somebody to check it out. Thanks for letting me know how many vehicles were involved in it. It looks like it may just be two. I saw one that was parked off to this side on 187th on the north side of Stark, or just north of Stark, I should say, but there was only, like I said, the one vehicle in the intersection, so it was hard to tell, but I'm pretty sure it was just two vehicles. All right. Copy that. Well, thanks for letting me know. Let me check it out and hope you have a great rest of your day. You as well. Thank you very much. 1523.</td></tr>
