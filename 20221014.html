Let's shoot for Powell and 181 inbound. As your starting point, I'm going to curtail your trip so you'll get a message just so the public knows you're not going to be out there. What? 903. So I don't go to heavenhood, no, because you're due there now and you're not going to make it. I just took the Division Street eastbound aggression one way. So should I go up to Division 180 first in Powell, southbound? Yes. So go ahead and continue our division. Make a right on 180 first, a right on Powell and you can start right there. So you know, I reported at 4 a.m. and the station agent just gave this a lot to me. So I wasn't informed that I needed to notify dispatch, so apologies. Yeah, I'm aware of that part of it, the station agent gave it to you late. But anytime you're leaving the garage, just give us a ready for service. So that we can talk to you and get you in place in the right place. Nothing against you. I knew that you were going to be late because the run went over before you shut up. But just if you know you're leaving the garage late, make sure and let this batch know. As far I have another question because I knew I didn't get the turn by turn. So just can you tell me real quickly what stops in the transit mall gone six and what stops on fifth I'm to land on? Oh, let me look real quick here. Hold on. All right. Let's see here.

So should I go up to Division 180 first in Powell, southbound? Yes. So go ahead and continue our division. Make a right on 180 first, a right on Powell and you can start right there. So you know, I reported at 4 a.m. and the station agent just gave this a lot to me. So I wasn't informed that I needed to notify dispatch, so apologies. Yeah, I'm aware of that part of it, the station agent gave it to you late. But anytime you're leaving the garage, just give us a ready for service. So that we can talk to you and get you in place in the right place. Nothing against you. I knew that you were going to be late because the run went over before you shut up. But just if you know you're leaving the garage late, make sure and let this batch know. As far I have another question because I knew I didn't get the turn by turn. So just can you tell me real quickly what stops in the transit mall gone six and what stops on fifth I'm to land on? Oh, let me look real quick here. Hold on. All right. Let's see here. It looks like you have a stop at Holland Fifth, Mill, Clay, and Maine. And then it looks like it's a W stops. Thank you very much. All right. Thank you. All right.</td></tr>

Let's shoot for Powell and 181 inbound. As your starting point, I'm going to curtail your trip so you'll get a message just so the public knows you're not going to be out there. What? 903. So I don't go to heavenhood, no, because you're due there now and you're not going to make it. I just took the Division Street eastbound aggression one way. So should I go up to Division 180 first in Powell, southbound? Yes. So go ahead and continue our division. Make a right on 180 first, a right on Powell and you can start right there. So you know, I reported at 4 a.m. and the station agent just gave this a lot to me. So I wasn't informed that I needed to notify dispatch, so apologies. Yeah, I'm aware of that part of it, the station agent gave it to you late. But anytime you're leaving the garage, just give us a ready for service. So that we can talk to you and get you in place in the right place. Nothing against you. I knew that you were going to be late because the run went over before you shut up. But just if you know you're leaving the garage late, make sure and let this batch know. As far I have another question because I knew I didn't get the turn by turn. So just can you tell me real quickly what stops in the transit mall gone six and what stops on fifth I'm to land on? Oh, let me look real quick here. Hold on. All right. Let's see here.

Let's shoot for Powell and 181 inbound. As your starting point, I'm going to curtail your trip so you'll get a message just so the public knows you're not going to be out there. What? 903. So I don't go to heavenhood, no, because you're due there now and you're not going to make it. I just took the Division Street eastbound aggression one way. So should I go up to Division 180 first in Powell, southbound? Yes. So go ahead and continue our division. Make a right on 180 first, a right on Powell and you can start right there. So you know, I reported at 4 a.m. and the station agent just gave this a lot to me. So I wasn't informed that I needed to notify dispatch, so apologies. Yeah, I'm aware of that part of it, the station agent gave it to you late. But anytime you're leaving the garage, just give us a ready for service. So that we can talk to you and get you in place in the right place. Nothing against you. I knew that you were going to be late because the run went over before you shut up. But just if you know you're leaving the garage late, make sure and let this batch know. As far I have another question because I knew I didn't get the turn by turn. So just can you tell me real quickly what stops in the transit mall gone six and what stops on fifth I'm to land on? Oh, let me look real quick here. Hold on. All right. Let's see here.

Let's shoot for Powell and 181 inbound. As your starting point, I'm going to curtail your trip so you'll get a message just so the public knows you're not going to be out there. What? 903. So I don't go to heavenhood, no, because you're due there now and you're not going to make it. I just took the Division Street eastbound aggression one way. So should I go up to Division 180 first in Powell, southbound? Yes. So go ahead and continue our division. Make a right on 180 first, a right on Powell and you can start right there. So you know, I reported at 4 a.m. and the station agent just gave this a lot to me. So I wasn't informed that I needed to notify dispatch, so apologies. Yeah, I'm aware of that part of it, the station agent gave it to you late. But anytime you're leaving the garage, just give us a ready for service. So that we can talk to you and get you in place in the right place. Nothing against you. I knew that you were going to be late because the run went over before you shut up. But just if you know you're leaving the garage late, make sure and let this batch know. As far I have another question because I knew I didn't get the turn by turn. So just can you tell me real quickly what stops in the transit mall gone six and what stops on fifth I'm to land on? Oh, let me look real quick here. Hold on. All right. Let's see here.
